# Timer

This application simulates a timer. The timer can be configured to countdown in given intervals using the text based menu. 
A time interval of 5, for example, will make the timer count down and print the current time once every 5 seconds. 
After setting the interval, you can set the amount of time in seconds. Finally, you can start the timer and watch it count down. 
An interval of 2 with a start time of 60 will result in a minute long timer that reports the seconds left every two seconds. 
This application uses Python's built in time module to utilize the time.sleep() function. A while loop wraps the whole thing making 
it reusable until the user decides to manually stop the program. Built in Python.
